      <description> Obejctives Obejctives Course objectives:
Provide basic knowledge about algorithms and data structures. Be able to choose appropriate data structures for a specific problem. Approach different algorithms and solve a problem in informatics. Why study Algorithms?
Many problems in informatics can be solved by using a computer. want it to go faster? process more data? want it to do something that would otherwise be impossible? Technology improves many aspects but might be costly good algorithmic design can do much better and cheaper super-computers cannot handle bad algorithms Data structure can make the algorithms much simpler, easier to maintain, and often faster </description>
