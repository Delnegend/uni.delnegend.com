      <description>Exercise 1 Exercise 2 Exercise 3 Exercise 4 Exercise 5 Exercise 6 Exercise 1 a) Consider rolling a six-sided dice. TThe set of outcomes where the roll is:
A: an even number. B: greater than 3. Calculate and compare the sets on both side of De Morgan&amp;rsquo;s law.
$(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$ $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$ Solution â†• $A = {2,4,6}$
$B = {4,5,6}$</description>

      <description>Exercise 1 Exercise 2 Exercise 3 Exercise 4 Exercise 5 Exercise 6 Exercise 7 Exercise 8 Exercise 1 A bin contains 5 defective (that immediately fail when put in use), 10 partially defective (that fail after a couple of hours of use), and 25 acceptable transistors. A transistor is chosen at random from the bin and put into use. If it does not immediately fail, what is the probability it is acceptable?</description>

      <description>Exercise 1 Exercise 1 A probability density function $PDF$ such that $$ f_X(x) = \begin{cases} cx^2 &amp;amp; \text{if } 0 &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; 3 \\ 0 &amp;amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$
a) Find the constant $c$ Expand â†• $\int_{0}^{3} cx^2 dx = 1$
$\Leftrightarrow c \times \int_{0}^{3} x^2 = 1$
$\Leftrightarrow c \times \frac{x^3}{3} \Bigg|_{0}^{3} = 1$
$\Leftrightarrow c \times \frac{3^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} = 1$
$\Leftrightarrow c \times \frac{27}{3} = 1$</description>

      <description>Question 1 a. Consider event $A$ and $B$. Prove that $P(A) = P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap B^c)$
b. The tree diagram shows a complete picture of the various probabilities associated with event $A$ and $B$. Find $P(A|B)$. It is noted that $A&amp;rsquo; = A^c$ and $B&amp;rsquo; = B^c$.
Question 2 Lisa goes to school by bicycle $60%$ of the time and by bus $40%$ of the time. If she uses her bicycle she arrives on time $95%$ of the time but if she catches the bus she comes late $2%$ of the time.</description>
